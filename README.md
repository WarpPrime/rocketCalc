# rocketCalc
 
 **RocketCalc** is a simple flight simulator (much unlike Kerbal Space Program) where users can design custom made rockets and fly them using their own guidance software, coded in JavaScript (designs, guidance, UI, everything pending). This is a pretty new project for me so expect frequent updates. Happy flying!
 
 ## Roadmap
  - Implement a UI!
  - Implement aerodynamic drag 
  - Add option for multistage rockets
  - Launch failures?

## Changelog
